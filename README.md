Crafting practical tools that fuse ideas into production-ready software.

</div>

## About

AlephTav Fusions is a home for projects that blend clean engineering, approachable DX, and real-world utility. We focus on small, composable tools that are easy to adopt and extend.

## What We Build

- Developer tooling and CLIs that reduce friction
- Lightweight services, integrations, and automation
- Templates and starter kits for rapid delivery
- Documentation-first examples and learning resources

## Explore

Check out our pinned repositories below for the latest and most useful projects. If you’re new here, a good first step is to browse open issues labelled `good first issue`.

## Get Involved

- Star repositories you find helpful — it helps others discover them
- Open issues for bugs, ideas, or questions
- Submit PRs for fixes, docs, and small enhancements
- Share feedback — we iterate quickly based on real usage

## Contributing

We welcome contributions of all kinds: code, docs, examples, and testing. If a repository has a `CONTRIBUTING.md`, start there. Otherwise:

1. Fork the repo and create a feature branch
2. Keep changes focused and documented
3. Open a PR with a clear description and screenshots/logs when helpful

## Communication

- Issues: use repository Issues for bugs and feature requests
- Discussions: if enabled, use Discussions for Q&A and ideas
- Security: report sensitive issues privately if a `SECURITY.md` exists; otherwise open a minimal, non-sensitive issue to request contact

## Tech Highlights

We favor pragmatic stacks with great ergonomics. Common choices across projects include:

- TypeScript/JavaScript, Python, Go (project-dependent)
- Modern tooling (e.g., PNPM/Yarn, Vite/Next.js, Poetry)
- CI via GitHub Actions
